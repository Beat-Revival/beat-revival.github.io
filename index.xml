      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In this series of posts, We&#39;ll be covering the ways that we lifted the hood on EA/DICE&#39;s MEC server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this post, We&#39;ll be covering packet capturing and decryption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What exactly is a packet? A packet is simply a small chunk of data that gets sent to and from the MEC server.&lt;br&gt;
They&#39;re critical to internet communication and contain a lot of juicy data that we would like to get our hands on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
However, game companies aren&#39;t (completely) stupid and do try to protect the packets that get sent and recieved. They do this with encryption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are ways to crack encryption. However, Catalyst uses somewhat recent encryption methods so there aren&#39;t many exploits.&lt;br&gt;
We also can&#39;t try and bruteforce guess the decryption key as to do that in a reasonable amount of time would require a quantum computer and we unfortunately don&#39;t own one of those :(
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Okay then, so how did we manage to get past it? Well the answer is to do with the server software that EA/DICE use.&lt;br&gt;
EA/DICE build all of their game servers on top of their own &#34;Blaze&#34; software. This software has been used to build all EA/DICE game servers roughly since 2008 and is indeed the software that is used for the MEC server.
&lt;br&gt;
The issue with using the same software across lots of different online games is that it makes more people want to take a stab at attacking it. Think of all the possibilities!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Well indeed, people did try to attack the Blaze server software and eventually were successful. Thus, the EA-MITM project was created.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
EA-MITM attacks Blaze&#39;s ProtoSSL implementation and bypasses it to give us access to those sweet sweet unencrypted packets as they enter and exit our computer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So that&#39;s where the story ends, right? Of course not! EA-MITM can only get us so far as Blaze data that&#39;s specific to Catalyst can only be revealed to us in binary, requiring them to be manually translated back to JSON, which is what we&#39;re working on right now with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ploxxxy/catalyst-mitm&#34;&gt;Catalyst-MITM&lt;/a&gt; project :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you would like to find out more about Blaze you can look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/DICEStudio/battlelog-building-scalable-web-sites-with-tight-game-integration&#34;&gt;this slideshow&lt;/a&gt; made by DICE. Do keep in mind however that it is pretty old and outdated :p

Welcome to the Beat Revival blog!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In this blog we&#39;ll be showcasing our progress and giving technical insight into what we&#39;re doing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We don&#39;t have anything to post right now ðŸ˜”. However, I urge you to watch the UGC stats video if you haven&#39;t already.
&lt;/p&gt;
